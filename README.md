This Android application uses TensorFlow Lite integrated with Microsoft Azure AI services to analyze and classify pottery sherds.
By taking an image as input, the app evaluates the probability (in percentage) that the sherd belongs to one of the following categories:
* 1900-Current
* Acoma Pueblo
* Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi)
* Hopi Pueblo
* (More to come)

## Disclaimer
This application is a tool for educational and informational purposes. 
It is crucial to approach the study and analysis of Native American artifacts with respect and responsibility. 
Handling, collecting, or analyzing artifacts like pottery sherds without appropriate permissions may violate cultural heritage laws or community agreements. 
Users are encouraged to consult with and seek approval from relevant tribal representatives and cultural organizations before engaging with artifacts to ensure ethical and respectful practices.

## Features
* Image-based Analysis: Upload an image of a pottery sherd for analysis.
* AI-Powered Classification: Uses a custom TensorFlow Lite model trained with Azure AI services. 
* Probability Outputs: Provides percentage probabilities for each possible category. 
* User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind for quick and efficient use.

## Tech Stack
* Android Studio: Built with Java/Kotlin.
* TensorFlow Lite: For AI/ML model inference.
* Microsoft Azure AI Services: To train and enhance the TensorFlow Lite model.
* Firebase (if applicable): For hosting or database management.

## Installation
Clone this repository:
* bash
* git clone https://github.com/AtomCreate/PotteryAI.git
 * Open the project in Android Studio.

* Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

* Or request to be a tester and I will send you a downloadable file via email.

## Usage
* Launch the app.
* Upload an image of a pottery sherd.
* View the analysis results with the category probabilities displayed on-screen.

# How it Works
* Image Input: The app accepts an image from the device or camera. 
* TensorFlow Lite Model: The image is analyzed using the embedded AI model.
* Classification: The model outputs probabilities for each pottery category.
* Display Results: The analysis is presented in a user-friendly format.
